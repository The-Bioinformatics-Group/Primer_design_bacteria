# Introduction
Genome sequence copied from /nobackup/data9/alvar/016_016536/.
I'm not sure the correct 16S sequence has been extracted from unitig_2 and stored in the file "unitig_2_16S_rev.fasta". Will tehrefore run V-Xtractor directoy on unitig_2.

# Result I
No V-regions was found (see aff_Kordia_algicida_V1-V9.csv). I will therefore try the same with unitig_1 (where we know there is a 16S) to see if V-Xtractor can handle this large file.

# Result II
A 16S region was found in unitig_1 (see aff_Kordia_jejudonensis_V1-V9.csv). I will reverse-complement unitig_2 and see if a 16S sequence can be found there.

# Result III
V-regions where found in the reverce-complemented unitig_2 sequence (see aff_Kordia_algicida_REV_V1-V9.csv). These sequences are identical to the one found in unitig_1.

# Conclusion
The sequence in /nobackup/data9/alvar/16S_data/cut_isolate/unitig_2/unitig_2_16S_rev.fasta on ALbiorix is not from unitig_2.

## genome_4
I'm having problems identifying the V-regions in the sequences genome_4_16S.fasta and genome_4_16S_rev.fasta as well. Will run V-Xtractor on the whole genome sequence instead. The sequence was copied from /state/partition1/home/alvar/db/bac_genome_4_db/Genome_4_conesnsus.fasta.
