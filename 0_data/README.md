# Introductions
This directory contains 16S sequences that Alvar has extracted from the three genomes he has assembled and analysed. The sequences from unitig_1 and 2 are from the same bacterial genome.

# Update
There seems to have been some mix-up of some of the sequence. The V-resions have instead been extracted from the whole genome sequences for some of the sequences (see 3_extracting_16S).
