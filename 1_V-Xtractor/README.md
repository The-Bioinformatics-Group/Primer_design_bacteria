# Introduction
Identifying the hypervariable V-regions in the ribosomal 16S gene using V-Xtractor.

# Workflow
* V-Xtractor run using the script runV-Xtractor.sh
* All resulting V-regions from the three genomes was then used as query sequences on the NCBI BLAST web server using the nr database.

# Result
### unitig_0
The V-regions of Unitig_0 mainly had 100% match over their full length, except for V1 and V8. No V9 region was identified. Primers will be designed for the two former regions.
